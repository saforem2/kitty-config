# vim:ft=kitty:fileencoding=utf-8:foldmethod=marker

font_size 16.0
undercurl_style thin-sparse

#: The style with which undercurls are rendered. This option takes the
#: form (thin|thick)-(sparse|dense). Thin and thick control the
#: thickness of the undercurl. Sparse and dense control how often the
#: curl oscillates. With sparse the curl will peak once per character,
#: with dense twice. Changing this option dynamically via reloading
#: the config or remote control is undefined.

#: Text cursor customization {{{

# cursor #cccccc

#: Default text cursor color. If set to the special value none the
#: cursor will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. Its color
#: will be the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text
#: will be rendered with the background color of the cell. Note that
#: if the program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this
#: takes precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast. Note that
#: some themes set this value, so if you want to override it, place
#: your value after the lines where the theme file is included.

# cursor_text_color #111111

#: The color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered with
#: the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: `background`. Note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this option is ignored. Note that some themes set this value,
#: so if you want to override it, place your value after the lines
#: where the theme file is included.

# cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

cursor_shape_unfocused hollow

#: Defines the text cursor shape when the OS window is not focused.
#: The unfocused cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline,
#: hollow and unchanged (leave the cursor shape as it is).

cursor_beam_thickness 1.5

#: The thickness of the beam cursor (in pts).

# cursor_underline_thickness 2.0

#: The thickness of the underline cursor (in pts).

cursor_blink_interval 2

#: The interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). Set to zero to
#: disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that the minimum interval will be limited to repaint_delay. You can
#: also animate the cursor blink by specifying an easing function. For
#: example, setting this to option to 0.5 ease-in-out will cause the
#: cursor blink to be animated over a second, in the first half of the
#: second it will go from opaque to transparent and then back again
#: over the next half. You can specify different easing functions for
#: the two halves, for example: -1 linear ease-out. kitty supports all
#: the CSS easing functions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
#: US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function>. Note that turning on animations
#: uses extra power as it means the screen is redrawn multiple times
#: per blink interval. See also, cursor_stop_blinking_after. This
#: setting also controls blinking text, which blinks in exact rhythm
#: with the cursor.

cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to never stop blinking. This
#: setting also controls blinking text, which blinks in exact rhythm
#: with the cursor.

cursor_trail 1

#: Set this to a value larger than zero to enable a "cursor trail"
#: animation. This is an animation that shows a "trail" following the
#: movement of the text cursor. It makes it easy to follow large
#: cursor jumps and makes for a cool visual effect of the cursor
#: zooming around the screen. The actual value of this option controls
#: when the animation is triggered. It is a number of milliseconds.
#: The trail animation only follows cursors that have stayed in their
#: position for longer than the specified number of milliseconds. This
#: prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change
#: their positions during UI updates in complex applications. See
#: cursor_trail_decay to control the animation speed and
#: cursor_trail_start_threshold to control when a cursor trail is
#: started.

cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.4

#: Controls the decay times for the cursor trail effect when the
#: cursor_trail is enabled. This option accepts two positive float
#: values specifying the fastest and slowest decay times in seconds.
#: The first value corresponds to the fastest decay time (minimum),
#: and the second value corresponds to the slowest decay time
#: (maximum). The second value must be equal to or greater than the
#: first value. Smaller values result in a faster decay of the cursor
#: trail. Adjust these values to control how quickly the cursor trail
#: fades away.

cursor_trail_start_threshold 2

#: Set the distance threshold for starting the cursor trail. This
#: option accepts a positive integer value that represents the minimum
#: number of cells the cursor must move before the trail is started.
#: When the cursor moves less than this threshold, the trail is
#: skipped, reducing unnecessary cursor trail animation.

# cursor_trail_color none

#: Set the color of the cursor trail when cursor_trail is enabled. If
#: set to 'none' (the default), the cursor trail will use the cursor's
#: background color. Otherwise, specify a color value (e.g., #ff0000
#: for red, or a named color like 'red'). This allows you to customize
#: the appearance of the cursor trail independently of the cursor
#: color.

#: }}}

#: Scrollback {{{

scrollback_lines 10000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

scrollbar scrolled

#: Control when the scrollbar is displayed.

#: scrolled
#:     means when the scrolling backwards has started.
#: hovered
#:     means when the mouse is hovering on the right edge of the window.
#: scrolled-and-hovered
#:     means when the mouse is over the scrollbar region *and* scrolling backwards has started.
#: always
#:     means whenever any scrollback is present
#: never
#:     means disable the scrollbar.

scrollbar_interactive yes

#: If disabled, the scrollbar will not be controllable via th emouse
#: and all mouse events will pass through the scrollbar.

# scrollbar_jump_on_click yes

#: When enabled clicking in the scrollbar track will cause the scroll
#: position to jump to the clicked location, otherwise the scroll
#: position will only move towards the position by a single screenful,
#: which is how traditional scrollbars behave.

# scrollbar_width 0.5

#: The width of the scroll bar in units of cell width.

# scrollbar_hover_width 1

#: The width of the scroll bar when the mouse is hovering over it, in
#: units of cell width.

# scrollbar_handle_opacity 0.5

#: The opacity of the scrollbar handle, 0 being fully transparent and
#: 1 being full opaque.

# scrollbar_radius 0.3

#: The radius (curvature) of the scrollbar handle in units of cell
#: width. Should be less than scrollbar_width.

# scrollbar_gap 0.1

#: The gap between the scrollbar and the window edge in units of cell
#: width.

# scrollbar_min_handle_height 1

#: The minimum height of the scrollbar handle in units of cell height.
#: Prevents the handle from becoming too small when there is a lot of
#: scrollback.

# scrollbar_hitbox_expansion 0.25

#: The extra area around the handle to allow easier grabbing of the
#: scollbar in units of cell width.

# scrollbar_track_opacity 0

#: The opacity of the scrollbar track, 0 being fully transparent and 1
#: being full opaque.

# scrollbar_track_hover_opacity 0.1

#: The opacity of the scrollbar track when the mouse is over the
#: scrollbar, 0 being fully transparent and 1 being full opaque.

# scrollbar_handle_color foreground

#: The color of the scrollbar handle. A value of foreground means to
#: use the current foreground text color, a value of
#: selection_background means to use the current selection background
#: color. Also, you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or
#: red.

# scrollbar_track_color foreground

#: The color of the scrollbar track. A value of foreground means to
#: use the current foreground text color, a value of
#: selection_background means to use the current selection background
#: color. Also, you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or
#: red.

# scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER
# scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER
# scrollback_pager less -r -FS
# scrollback_pager less -Sur

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
#: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position or
#: set to 0 if there is no cursor, for example, when showing the last
#: command output.

#: If you would rather use neovim to view the scrollback, use
#: something like this::

#:     scrollback_pager nvim --cmd 'set eventignore=FileType' +'nnoremap q ZQ' +'call nvim_open_term(0, {})' +'set nomodified nolist' +'$' -
scrollback_pager nvim --cmd 'set eventignore=FileType' +'nnoremap q ZQ' +'call nvim_open_term(0, {})' +'set nomodified nolist' +'$' -

#: The above works for neovim 0.12 and newer. There is also a
#: dedicated plugin kitty-scrollback.nvim
#: <https://github.com/mikesmithgh/kitty-scrollback.nvim> you can use
#: with more features that works with older neovim as well.

scrollback_pager_history_size 4000

#: Separate scrollback history size (in MB), used only for browsing
#: the scrollback buffer with pager. This separate buffer is not
#: available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager
#: program when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The
#: current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximately
#: 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

# scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

#: Fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after
#: enlarging a window.

# wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel.
#: Note that this is only used for low precision scrolling devices,
#: not for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS
#: and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction. See
#: also wheel_scroll_min_lines.

# wheel_scroll_min_lines 1

#: The minimum number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel. The scroll
#: multiplier wheel_scroll_multiplier only takes effect after it
#: reaches this number. Note that this is only used for low precision
#: scrolling devices like wheel mice that scroll by very small amounts
#: when using the wheel. With a negative number, the minimum number of
#: lines will always be added.

# touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by a touchpad. Note
#: that this is only used for high precision scrolling devices on
#: platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change
#: scroll direction.

#: }}}

#: Performance tuning {{{

# repaint_delay 10

#: Delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to
#: either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high
#: refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input
#: to be processed, this option is ignored.

# input_delay 3

#: Delay before input from the program running in the terminal is
#: processed (in milliseconds). Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.
#: This setting is ignored when the input buffer is almost full.

# sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents screen tearing
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing> when scrolling.
#: However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your
#: monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate,
#: you may notice some slight input latency. If so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

# enable_audio_bell no

#: The audio bell. Useful to disable it in environments that require
#: silence.

# visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: The visual bell duration (in seconds). Flash the screen when a bell
#: occurs for the specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.
#: The flash is animated, fading in and out over the specified
#: duration. The easing function used for the fading can be
#: controlled. For example, 2.0 linear will casuse the flash to fade
#: in and out linearly. The default if unspecified is to use ease-in-
#: out which fades slowly at the start, middle and end. You can
#: specify different easing functions for the fade-in and fade-out
#: parts, like this: 2.0 ease-in linear. kitty supports all the CSS
#: easing functions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
#: US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function>.

# visual_bell_color none

#: The color used by visual bell. Set to none will fall back to
#: selection background color. If you feel that the visual bell is too
#: bright, you can set it to a darker color.

# window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on Linux.

# bell_on_tab "🔔 "

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has a bell. If you want to use leading
#: or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

#: For backwards compatibility, values of yes, y and true are
#: converted to the default bell symbol and no, n, false and none are
#: converted to the empty string.

# command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable
#: KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

# bell_path none

#: Path to a sound file to play as the bell sound. If set to none, the
#: system default bell sound is used. Must be in a format supported by
#: the operating systems sound API, such as WAV or OGA on Linux
#: (libcanberra) or AIFF, MP3 or WAV on macOS (NSSound). Relative
#: paths are resolved with respect to the kitty config directory.

# linux_bell_theme __custom

#: The XDG Sound Theme kitty will use to play the bell sound. On
#: Wayland, when the compositor supports it, it is asked to play the
#: system default bell sound, and this setting has no effect. Note
#: that Hyprland claims to support this protocol, but does not
#: actually play a sound
#: <https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/issues/10488>. This setting
#: defaults to the custom theme name specified in the XDG Sound theme
#: specification <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/sound-theme-
#: spec/latest/sound_lookup.html>, falling back to the default
#: freedesktop theme if it does not exist. To change your sound theme
#: desktop wide, create
#: :file:~/.local/share/sounds/__custom/index.theme` with the
#: contents:

#:     [Sound Theme]

#:     Inherits=name-of-the-sound-theme-you-want-to-use

#: Replace name-of-the-sound-theme-you-want-to-use with the actual
#: theme name. Now all compliant applications should use sounds from
#: this theme.

#: }}}

#: Window layout {{{

# remember_window_size  yes
# initial_window_width  640
# initial_window_height 400

#: If enabled, the OS Window size will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same size as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the OS Window will initially have size
#: configured by initial_window_width/height, in pixels. You can use a
#: suffix of "c" on the width/height values to have them interpreted
#: as number of cells instead of pixels.

# remember_window_position no

#: If enabled, the OS Window position will be remembered so that new
#: instances of kitty will have the same position as the previous
#: instance. If disabled, the OS Window will be placed by the window
#: manager. Note that remembering of position only works if the
#: underlying desktop environment/window manager supports it. It never
#: works on Wayland. See also kitty --position to specify the position
#: when launching kitty.

# enabled_layouts *
enabled_layouts splits, stack

#: The enabled window layouts. A comma separated list of layout names.
#: The special value all means all layouts. The first listed layout
#: will be used as the startup layout. Default configuration is all
#: layouts in alphabetical order. For a list of available layouts, see
#: the layouts <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#layouts>.

# window_resize_step_cells 2
# window_resize_step_lines 2

#: The step size (in units of cell width/cell height) to use when
#: resizing kitty windows in a layout with the shortcut
#: start_resizing_window. The cells value is used for horizontal
#: resizing, and the lines value is used for vertical resizing.

window_border_width 1

#: The width of window borders. Can be either in pixels (px) or pts
#: (pt). Values in pts will be rounded to the nearest number of pixels
#: based on screen resolution. If not specified, the unit is assumed
#: to be pts. Note that borders are displayed only when more than one
#: window is visible. They are meant to separate multiple windows.

draw_minimal_borders no

#: Draw only the minimum borders needed. This means that only the
#: borders that separate the window from a neighbor are drawn. Note
#: that setting a non-zero window_margin_width overrides this and
#: causes all borders to be drawn.

# draw_window_borders_for_single_window no

#: Draw borders around a window even when there is only a single
#: window visible. When enabled and there is only a single window,
#: full borders are drawn around it (as if draw_minimal_borders is
#: false). The border will show in the active color when the window is
#: focused and the OS window has focus, and in the inactive color when
#: the OS window loses focus. This provides a clear visual indicator
#: of whether the kitty window is focused. When there are multiple
#: windows visible, this option has no effect and normal border
#: drawing rules apply.

window_margin_width 0

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

# single_window_margin_width -1

#: The window margin to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). Negative values will cause the value of window_margin_width
#: to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# window_padding_width 5 5
window_padding_width 2

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# single_window_padding_width -1

#: The window padding to use when only a single window is visible (in
#: pts). Negative values will cause the value of window_padding_width
#: to be used instead. A single value sets all four sides. Two values
#: set the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top,
#: horizontal and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# placement_strategy center

#: When the window size is not an exact multiple of the cell size, the
#: cell area of the terminal window will have some extra padding on
#: the sides. You can control how that padding is distributed with
#: this option. Using a value of center means the cell area will be
#: placed centrally. A value of top-left means the padding will be
#: only at the bottom and right edges. The value can be one of: top-
#: left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left, bottom,
#: bottom-right.

# active_border_color #00ff00

#: The color for the border of the active window. Set this to none to
#: not draw borders around the active window.

# inactive_border_color #cccccc

#: The color for the border of inactive windows.

# bell_border_color #ff5a00

#: The color for the border of inactive windows in which a bell has
#: occurred.

# inactive_text_alpha 1.0
# inactive_text_alpha 0.75

#: Fade the text in inactive windows by the specified amount (a number
#: between zero and one, with zero being fully faded).

hide_window_decorations yes

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only and titlebar-and-corners can be used
#: to only hide the titlebar and the rounded corners. Whether this
#: works and exactly what effect it has depends on the window
#: manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing this
#: option when reloading config are undefined. When using titlebar-
#: only, it is useful to also set window_margin_width and
#: placement_strategy to prevent the rounded corners from clipping
#: text. Or use titlebar-and-corners.

# window_logo_path none

#: Path to a logo image. Must be in PNG/JPEG/WEBP/GIF/TIFF/BMP format.
#: Relative paths are interpreted relative to the kitty config
#: directory. The logo is displayed in a corner of every kitty window.
#: The position is controlled by window_logo_position. Individual
#: windows can be configured to have different logos either using the
#: launch action or the remote control
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-control/> facility.

# window_logo_position bottom-right

#: Where to position the window logo in the window. The value can be
#: one of: top-left, top, top-right, left, center, right, bottom-left,
#: bottom, bottom-right.

# window_logo_alpha 0.5

#: The amount the logo should be faded into the background. With zero
#: being fully faded and one being fully opaque.

# window_logo_scale 0

#: The percentage (0-100] of the window size to which the logo should
#: scale. Using a single number means the logo is scaled to that
#: percentage of the shortest window dimension, while preserving
#: aspect ratio of the logo image.

#: Using two numbers means the width and height of the logo are scaled
#: to the respective percentage of the window's width and height.

#: Using zero as the percentage disables scaling in that dimension. A
#: single zero (the default) disables all scaling of the window logo.

# resize_debounce_time 0.1 0.5

#: The time to wait (in seconds) before asking the program running in
#: kitty to resize and redraw the screen during a live resize of the
#: OS window, when no new resize events have been received, i.e. when
#: resizing is either paused or finished. On platforms such as macOS,
#: where the operating system sends events corresponding to the start
#: and end of a live resize, the second number is used for redraw-
#: after-pause since kitty can distinguish between a pause and end of
#: resizing. On such systems the first number is ignored and redraw is
#: immediate after end of resize. On other systems only the first
#: number is used so that kitty is "ready" quickly after the end of
#: resizing, while not also continuously redrawing, to save energy.

# resize_in_steps no

#: Resize the OS window in steps as large as the cells, instead of
#: with the usual pixel accuracy. Combined with initial_window_width
#: and initial_window_height in number of cells, this option can be
#: used to keep the margins as small as possible when resizing the OS
#: window. Note that this does not currently work on Wayland.

# visual_window_select_characters 1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

#: The list of characters for visual window selection. For example,
#: for selecting a window to focus on with focus_visible_window. The
#: value should be a series of unique numbers or alphabets, case
#: insensitive, from the set 0-9A-Z\-=[];',./\\`. Specify your
#: preference as a string of characters.

# confirm_os_window_close -1

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. You can also have
#: backgrounded jobs prevent closing, by adding count-background to
#: the setting, for example: -1 count-background. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.

#:     The tab bar is hidden. If you use this, you might want to create
#:     a mapping for the select_tab action which presents you with a list of
#:     tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

# tab_bar_filter

#: A search expression <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/#search-syntax>. Only tabs that match this expression will
#: be shown in the tab bar. The currently active tab is always shown,
#: regardless of whether it matches or not. When using this option,
#: the tab bar may be displayed with less tabs than specified in
#: tab_bar_min_tabs, as evaluating the filter is expensive and is done
#: only at display time. This is most useful when using sessions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/sessions/>. An expression of
#: session:~ or session:^$ will show only tabs that belong to the
#: current session or no session. The various tab navigation actions
#: such as goto_tab, next_tab, previous_tab, etc. are automatically
#: restricted to work only on matching tabs.

# tab_bar_align left

#: The horizontal alignment of the tab bar, can be one of: left,
#: center, right.

# tab_bar_min_tabs 2

#: The minimum number of tabs that must exist before the tab bar is
#: shown.

# tab_switch_strategy previous

#: The algorithm to use when switching to a tab when the current tab
#: is closed. The default of previous will switch to the last used
#: tab. A value of left will switch to the tab to the left of the
#: closed tab. A value of right will switch to the tab to the right of
#: the closed tab. A value of last will switch to the right-most tab.

# tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75
# tab_fade 0.1 0.5 0.9
# tab_fade 0.25 0.5 0.75 1

#: Control how each tab fades into the background when using fade for
#: the tab_bar_style. Each number is an alpha (between zero and one)
#: that controls how much the corresponding cell fades into the
#: background, with zero being no fade and one being full fade. You
#: can change the number of cells used by adding/removing entries to
#: this list.

# tab_separator " ┇"

#: The separator between tabs in the tab bar when using separator as
#: the tab_bar_style.

# tab_powerline_style angled

#: The powerline separator style between tabs in the tab bar when
#: using powerline as the tab_bar_style, can be one of: angled,
#: slanted, round.

# tab_activity_symbol " "
# tab_activity_symbol "● "
# tab_activity_symbol "󰿦 "
# tab_activity_symbol "●"
# tab_activity_symbol " "

#: Some text or a Unicode symbol to show on the tab if a window in the
#: tab that does not have focus has some activity. If you want to use
#: leading or trailing spaces, surround the text with quotes. See
#: tab_title_template for how this is rendered.

# tab_title_max_length 0

#: The maximum number of cells that can be used to render the text in
#: a tab. A value of zero means that no limit is applied.

#
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
inactive_tab_font_style normal
# tab_max_title_length 40

#: A template to render the tab title. The default just renders the
#: title with optional symbols for bell and activity. If you wish to
#: include the tab-index as well, use something like: {index}:{title}.
#: Useful if you have shortcuts mapped for goto_tab N. If you prefer
#: to see the index as a superscript, use {sup.index}. All data
#: available is:

#: title
#:     The current tab title.
#: index
#:     The tab index usable with goto_tab N goto_tab shortcuts.
#: layout_name
#:     The current layout name.
#: session_name
#:     The name of the kitty session file from which this tab was created, if any.
#: active_session_name
#:     The name of the kitty session file from which the active window in this tab was created, if any.
#: num_windows
#:     The number of windows in the tab.
#: num_window_groups
#:     The number of window groups (a window group is a window and all of its overlay windows) in the tab.
#: tab.active_wd
#:     The working directory of the currently active window in the tab
#:     (expensive, requires syscall). Use tab.active_oldest_wd to get
#:     the directory of the oldest foreground process rather than the newest.
#: tab.active_exe
#:     The name of the executable running in the foreground of the currently
#:     active window in the tab (expensive, requires syscall). Use
#:     tab.active_oldest_exe for the oldest foreground process.
#: max_title_length
#:     The maximum title length available.
#: keyboard_mode
#:     The name of the current keyboard mode <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/mapping/#modal-mappings> or the empty string if no keyboard mode is active.
#: tab.last_focused_progress_percent
#:     If a command running in a window reports the progress for a task, show this progress as a percentage
#:     from the most recently focused window in the tab. Empty string if no progress is reported.
#: tab.progress_percent
#:     If a command running in a window reports the progress for a task, show this progress as a percentage
#:     from all windows in the tab, averaged. Empty string is no progress is reported.
#: custom
#:     This will call a function named draw_title(data) from the file tab_bar.py placed in
#:     the kitty config directory. The function will be passed a dictionary of data, the same data that
#:     can be used in this template. It can then perform arbitrarily complex processing and return a string.
#:     For example: tab_title_template "{custom}" will use the output of the function as the tab title.
#:     Any print statements in the draw_title() will print to the STDOUT of the kitty process, useful
#:     for debugging.


#: Note that formatting is done by Python's string formatting
#: machinery, so you can use, for instance, {layout_name[:2].upper()}
#: to show only the first two letters of the layout name, upper-cased.
#: If you want to style the text, you can use styling directives, for
#: example:
#: `{fmt.fg.red}red{fmt.fg.tab}normal{fmt.bg._00FF00}greenbg{fmt.bg.tab}`.
#: Similarly, for bold and italic:
#: `{fmt.bold}bold{fmt.nobold}normal{fmt.italic}italic{fmt.noitalic}`.
#: The 256 eight terminal colors can be used as `fmt.fg.color0`
#: through `fmt.fg.color255`. Note that for backward compatibility, if
#: {bell_symbol} or {activity_symbol} are not present in the template,
#: they are prepended to it.

# active_tab_title_template none

#: Template to use for active tabs. If not specified falls back to
#: tab_title_template.

# active_tab_foreground   #000
# active_tab_background   #eee
# active_tab_font_style   bold-italic
# inactive_tab_foreground #444
# inactive_tab_background #999
# inactive_tab_font_style normal

#: Tab bar colors and styles.

# tab_bar_background none

#: Background color for the tab bar. Defaults to using the terminal
#: background color.

# tab_bar_margin_color none

#: Color for the tab bar margin area. Defaults to using the terminal
#: background color for margins above and below the tab bar. For side
#: margins the default color is chosen to match the background color
#: of the neighboring tab.

#: }}}

#: Color scheme {{{

# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: The foreground and background colors.

# background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. See also transparent_background_colors. Be aware that using
#: a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit.
#: When using a low value for this setting, it is desirable that you
#: set the background color to a color the matches the general color
#: of the desktop background, for best text rendering.

#: If you want to dynamically change transparency of windows, set
#: dynamic_background_opacity to yes (this is off by default as it has
#: a performance cost). Changing this option when reloading the config
#: will only work if dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the
#: original config.

# background_blur 0

#: Set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the
#: visuals behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it.
#: Only takes effect when background_opacity is less than one. On
#: macOS, this will also control the blur radius (amount of blurring).
#: Setting it to too high a value will cause severe performance issues
#: and/or rendering artifacts. Usually, values up to 64 work well.
#: Note that this might cause performance issues, depending on how the
#: platform implements it, so use with care. Currently supported on
#: macOS and KDE.

# transparent_background_colors

#: A space separated list of upto 7 colors, with opacity. When the
#: background color of a cell matches one of these colors, it is
#: rendered semi-transparent using the specified opacity.

#: Useful in more complex UIs like editors where you could want more
#: than a single background color to be rendered as transparent, for
#: instance, for a cursor highlight line background or a highlighted
#: block. Terminal applications can set this color using The kitty
#: color control <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/color-stack/#color-
#: control> escape code.

#: The syntax for specifying colors is: color@opacity, where the
#: @opacity part is optional. When unspecified, the value of
#: background_opacity is used. For example::

#:     transparent_background_colors red@0.5 #00ff00@0.3

#: Note that you must also set background_opacity to something less
#: than 1 for this setting to work properly.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG/JPEG/WEBP/TIFF/GIF/BMP
#: format. Note that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped, centered or
#: cscaled. The scaled and cscaled values scale the image to the
#: window size, with cscaled preserving the image aspect ratio. Note
#: that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used. Note that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. This
#: option makes it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. This option applies only
#: if background_image is set. Note that when using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# background_tint_gaps 1.0

#: How much to tint the background image at the window gaps by the
#: background color, after applying background_tint. Since this is
#: multiplicative with background_tint, it can be used to lighten the
#: tint over the window gaps for a *separated* look. Note that when
#: using auto_color_scheme
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/#auto-color-scheme>
#: this option is overridden by the color scheme file and must be set
#: inside it to take effect.

# dim_opacity 0.4

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #fffacd

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.

#: Advanced {{{

shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: the value of of the SHELL environment variable or if unset,
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files. Environment
#: variables are expanded in this setting.

# editor .

#: The terminal based text editor (such as vim or nano) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: The default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. If these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell ($SHELL -l -i -c env) to see if your
#: shell startup rc files set VISUAL or EDITOR. If that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (vim, emacs, etc.)
#: and take the first one that exists on your system.

# close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (usually the shell) exits.
#: With the default value no, the terminal will remain open when the
#: child exits as long as there are still other processes outputting
#: to the terminal (for example disowned or backgrounded processes).
#: When enabled with yes, the window will close as soon as the child
#: process exits. Note that setting it to yes means that any
#: background processes still using the terminal can fail silently
#: because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

# remote_control_password

#: Allow other programs to control kitty using passwords. This option
#: can be specified multiple times to add multiple passwords. If no
#: passwords are present kitty will ask the user for permission if a
#: program tries to use remote control with a password. A password can
#: also *optionally* be associated with a set of allowed remote
#: control actions. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" get-colors set-colors focus-window focus-tab

#: Only the specified actions will be allowed when using this
#: password. Glob patterns can be used too, for example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" set-tab-* resize-*

#: To get a list of available actions, run::

#:     kitten @ --help

#: A set of actions to be allowed when no password is sent can be
#: specified by using an empty password. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "" *-colors

#: Finally, the path to a python module can be specified that provides
#: a function is_cmd_allowed that is used to check every remote
#: control command. For example::

#:     remote_control_password "my passphrase" my_rc_command_checker.py

#: Relative paths are resolved from the kitty configuration directory.
#: See rc_custom_auth <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/remote-
#: control/#rc-custom-auth> for details.

allow_remote_control yes

# forward_remote_control yes

#: Forward the kitty remote control socket to the remote host. This allows using the kitty remote control facilities from the remote host. WARNING: This allows any software on the remote host full access to the local computer, so only do it for trusted remote hosts. Note that this does not work with abstract UNIX sockets such as @mykitty because of SSH limitations. This option uses SSH socket forwarding to forward the socket pointed to by the KITTY_LISTEN_ON environment variable.

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on, other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over SSH
#: connections. The default setting of no prevents any form of remote
#: control. The meaning of the various values are:

#: password
#:     Remote control requests received over both the TTY device and the socket
#:     are confirmed based on passwords, see remote_control_password.

#: socket-only
#:     Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. Requests received over the TTY are denied.
#:     See listen_on.

#: socket
#:     Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. Requests received over the TTY are confirmed based on
#:     password.

#: no
#:     Remote control is completely disabled.

#: yes
#:     Remote control requests are always accepted.

listen_on unix:/tmp/kitty
# listen_on none

#: Listen to the specified socket for remote control connections. Note
#: that this will apply to all kitty instances. It can be overridden
#: by the kitty --listen-on command line option. For UNIX sockets,
#: such as unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or unix:@mykitty (on Linux).
#: Environment variables are expanded and relative paths are resolved
#: with respect to the temporary directory. If {kitty_pid} is present,
#: then it is replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the
#: PID of the kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen.
#: For TCP sockets such as tcp:localhost:0 a random port is always
#: used even if a non-zero port number is specified.  See the help for
#: kitty --listen-on for more details. Note that this will be ignored
#: unless allow_remote_control is set to either: yes, socket or
#: socket-only. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# env

#: Specify the environment variables to be set in all child processes.
#: Using the name with an equal sign (e.g. env VAR=) will set it to
#: the empty string. Specifying only the name (e.g. env VAR) will
#: remove the variable from the child process' environment. Note that
#: environment variables are expanded recursively, for example::

#:     env VAR1=a
#:     env VAR2=${HOME}/${VAR1}/b

#: The value of VAR2 will be <path to home directory>/a/b.

#: Use the special value read_from_shell to have kitty read the
#: specified variables from your login shell shell configuration.
#: Useful if your shell startup files setup a bunch of environment
#: variables that you want available to kitty and in kitty session
#: files. Each variable name is treated as a glob pattern to match.
#: For example: env read_from_shell=PATH LANG LC_* XDG_* EDITOR
#: VISUAL. Note that these variables are only read after the
#: configuration is fully processed, thus they are not available for
#: recursive expansion and they will override any variables set by
#: other env directives.

# filter_notification

#: Specify rules to filter out notifications sent by applications
#: running in kitty. Can be specified multiple times to create
#: multiple filter rules. A rule specification is of the form
#: field:regexp. A filter rule can match on any of the fields: title,
#: body, app, type. The special value of all filters out all
#: notifications. Rules can be combined using Boolean operators. Some
#: examples::

#:     filter_notification title:hello or body:"abc.*def"
#:     # filter out notification from vim except for ones about updates, (?i)
#:     # makes matching case insensitive.
#:     filter_notification app:"[ng]?vim" and not body:"(?i)update"
#:     # filter out all notifications
#:     filter_notification all

#: The field app is the name of the application sending the
#: notification and type is the type of the notification. Not all
#: applications will send these fields, so you can also match on the
#: title and body of the notification text. More sophisticated
#: programmatic filtering and custom actions on notifications can be
#: done by creating a notifications.py file in the kitty config
#: directory (~/.config/kitty). An annotated sample is available
#: <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/blob/master/docs/notifications.py>.

# watcher

#: Path to python file which will be loaded for watchers
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/#watchers>. Can be
#: specified more than once to load multiple watchers. The watchers
#: will be added to every kitty window. Relative paths are resolved
#: relative to the kitty config directory. Note that reloading the
#: config will only affect windows created after the reload.

# exe_search_path

#: Control where kitty finds the programs to run. The default search
#: order is: First search the system wide PATH, then ~/.local/bin and
#: ~/bin. If still not found, the PATH defined in the login shell
#: after sourcing all its startup files is tried. Finally, if present,
#: the PATH specified by the env option is tried.

#: This option allows you to prepend, append, or remove paths from
#: this search order. It can be specified multiple times for multiple
#: paths. A simple path will be prepended to the search order. A path
#: that starts with the + sign will be append to the search order,
#: after ~/bin above. A path that starts with the - sign will be
#: removed from the entire search order. For example::

#:     exe_search_path /some/prepended/path
#:     exe_search_path +/some/appended/path
#:     exe_search_path -/some/excluded/path

# update_check_interval 24

#: The interval to periodically check if an update to kitty is
#: available (in hours). If an update is found, a system notification
#: is displayed informing you of the available update. The default is
#: to check every 24 hours, set to zero to disable. Update checking is
#: only done by the official binary builds. Distro packages or source
#: builds do not do update checking. Changing this option by reloading
#: the config is not supported.

# startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session =none command line option
#: for individual instances. See sessions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/sessions/> in the kitty
#: documentation for details. Note that relative paths are interpreted
#: with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment variables
#: in the path are expanded. Changing this option by reloading the
#: config is not supported. Note that if kitty is invoked with command
#: line arguments specifying a command to run, this option is ignored.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask
clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard read-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

# clipboard_max_size 512

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.

# file_transfer_confirmation_bypass

#: The password that can be supplied to the file transfer kitten
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/transfer/> to skip the
#: transfer confirmation prompt. This should only be used when
#: initiating transfers from trusted computers, over trusted networks
#: or encrypted transports, as it allows any programs running on the
#: remote machine to read/write to the local filesystem, without
#: permission.

allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink escape sequences (OSC 8). If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click with the mouse or by using the hints
#: kitten <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints/>. The
#: special value of ask means that kitty will ask before opening the
#: link when clicked.

shell_integration enabled

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells. Set to
#: disabled to turn off shell integration, completely. It is also
#: possible to disable individual features, set to a space separated
#: list of these values: no-rc, no-cursor, no-title, no-cwd, no-
#: prompt-mark, no-complete, no-sudo. See Shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> for details.

allow_cloning yes

#: Control whether programs running in the terminal can request new
#: windows to be created. The canonical example is clone-in-kitty
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#clone-shell>.
#: By default, kitty will ask for permission for each clone request.
#: Allowing cloning unconditionally gives programs running in the
#: terminal (including over SSH) permission to execute arbitrary code,
#: as the user who is running the terminal, on the computer that the
#: terminal is running on.

# clone_source_strategies venv,conda,env_var,path

#: Control what shell code is sourced when running clone-in-kitty in
#: the newly cloned window. The supported strategies are:

#: venv
#:     Source the file $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/activate. This is used by the
#:     Python stdlib venv module and allows cloning venvs automatically.
#: conda
#:     Run conda activate $CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV. This supports the virtual
#:     environments created by conda.
#: env_var
#:     Execute the contents of the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_CODE with eval.
#: path
#:     Source the file pointed to by the environment variable
#:     KITTY_CLONE_SOURCE_PATH.

#: This option must be a comma separated list of the above values.
#: Only the first valid match, in the order specified, is sourced.

# notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused
notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 command notify-send "job finished with status: %s" %c

#: Show a desktop notification when a long-running command finishes
#: (needs shell_integration). The possible values are:

#: never
#:     Never send a notification.

#: unfocused
#:     Only send a notification when the window does not have keyboard focus.

#: invisible
#:     Only send a notification when the window both is unfocused and not visible
#:     to the user, for example, because it is in an inactive tab or its OS window
#:     is not currently visible (on platforms that support OS window visibility querying
#:     this considers an OS Window visible iff it is active).

#: always
#:     Always send a notification, regardless of window state.

#: There are two optional arguments:

#: First, the minimum duration for what is considered a long running
#: command. The default is 5 seconds. Specify a second argument to set
#: the duration. For example: invisible 15. Do not set the value too
#: small, otherwise a command that launches a new OS Window and exits
#: will spam a notification.

#: Second, the action to perform. The default is notify. The possible
#: values are:

#: notify
#:     Send a desktop notification. The subsequent arguments are optional and specify when
#:     the notification is automatically cleared. The set of possible events when the notification is
#:     cleared are: focus and next. focus means that when the notification
#:     policy is unfocused or invisible the notification is automatically cleared
#:     when the window regains focus. The value of next means that the previous notification
#:     is cleared when the next notification is shown. The default when no arguments are specified
#:     is: focus next.

#: bell
#:     Ring the terminal bell.

#: notify-bell
#:     Send a desktop notification and ring the terminal bell.
#:     The arguments are the same as for `notify`.

#: command
#:     Run a custom command. All subsequent arguments are the cmdline to run.

#: Some more examples::

#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 5 seconds in an unfocused window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused
#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0
#:     # Ring a bell when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 bell
#:     # Run 'notify-send' when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     # Here %c is replaced by the current command line and %s by the job exit code
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 command notify-send "job finished with status: %s" %c
#:     # Do not clear previous notification when next command finishes or window regains focus
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 5.0 notify

# term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

# terminfo_type path

#: The value of the TERMINFO environment variable to set. This
#: variable is used by programs running in the terminal to search for
#: terminfo databases. The default value of path causes kitty to set
#: it to a filesystem location containing the kitty terminfo database.
#: A value of direct means put the entire database into the env var
#: directly. This can be useful when connecting to containers, for
#: example. But, note that not all software supports this. A value of
#: none means do not touch the variable.

# forward_stdio no

#: Forward STDOUT and STDERR of the kitty process to child processes.
#: This is useful for debugging as it allows child processes to print
#: to kitty's STDOUT directly. For example, echo hello world
#: >&$KITTY_STDIO_FORWARDED in a shell will print to the parent
#: kitty's STDOUT. Sets the KITTY_STDIO_FORWARDED=fdnum environment
#: variable so child processes know about the forwarding. Note that on
#: macOS this prevents the shell from being run via the login utility
#: so getlogin() will not work in programs run in this session.

# menu_map

#: Specify entries for various menus in kitty. Currently only the
#: global menubar on macOS is supported. For example::

#:    menu_map global "Actions::Launch something special" launch --hold --type=os-window sh -c "echo hello world"

#: This will create a menu entry named "Launch something special" in
#: an "Actions" menu in the macOS global menubar. Sub-menus can be
#: created by adding more levels separated by the :: characters.

# remote_kitty if-needed
remote_kitty yes
#: Make kitty available on the remote host. Useful to run kittens such as the icat kitten to display
#: images or the transfer file kitten to transfer files. Only works if the remote host has an
#: architecture for which pre-compiled kitty binaries are available. Note that kitty is not actually
#: copied to the remote host, instead a small bootstrap script is copied which will download and run
#: kitty when kitty is first executed on the remote host. A value of if-needed means kitty is
#: installed only if not already present in the system-wide PATH. A value of yes means that kitty is
#: installed even if already present, and the installed kitty takes precedence. Finally, no means no
#: kitty is installed on the remote host. The installed kitty can be updated by running: kitty
#: +update-kitty on the remote host.
