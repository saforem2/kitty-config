#: Adjust the vertical alignment of text (the height in the cell at
#: which text is positioned). You can use either numbers, which are
#: interpreted as pixels or a percentages (number followed by %),
#: which are interpreted as the percentage of the line height. A
#: positive value moves the baseline up, and a negative value moves
#: them down. The underline and strikethrough positions are adjusted
#: accordingly.

# modify_font                     strikethrough_position 120%

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

#: You can specify different fonts for the bold/italic/bold-italic
#: variants. To get a full list of supported fonts use the `kitty
#: +list-fonts` command. By default they are derived automatically, by
#: the OSes font system. When bold_font or bold_italic_font is set to
#: auto on macOS, the priority of bold fonts is semi-bold, bold,
#: heavy. Setting them manually is useful for font families that have
#: many weight variants like Book, Medium, Thick, etc. For example::

#:     font_family      Operator Mono Book
#:     bold_font        Operator Mono Medium
#:     italic_font      Operator Mono Book Italic
#:     bold_italic_font Operator Mono Medium Italic


#: Font size (in pts)

force_ltr yes

#: kitty does not support BIDI (bidirectional text), however, for RTL
#: scripts, words are automatically displayed in RTL. That is to say,
#: in an RTL script, the words "HELLO WORLD" display in kitty as
#: "WORLD HELLO", and if you try to select a substring of an RTL-
#: shaped string, you will get the character that would be there had
#: the the string been LTR. For example, assuming the Hebrew word
#: ירושלים, selecting the character that on the screen appears to be ם
#: actually writes into the selection buffer the character י.  kitty's
#: default behavior is useful in conjunction with a filter to reverse
#: the word order, however, if you wish to manipulate RTL glyphs, it
#: can be very challenging to work with, so this option is provided to
#: turn it off. Furthermore, this option can be used with the command
#: line program GNU FriBidi
#: <https://github.com/fribidi/fribidi#executable> to get BIDI
#: support, because it will force kitty to always treat the text as
#: LTR, which FriBidi expects for terminals.

disable_ligatures cursor

#: Choose how you want to handle multi-character ligatures. The
#: default is to always render them.  You can tell kitty to not render
#: them when the cursor is over them by using cursor to make editing
#: easier, or have kitty never render them at all by using always, if
#: you don't like them. The ligature strategy can be set per-window
#: either using the kitty remote control facility or by defining
#: shortcuts for it in kitty.conf, for example::

#:     map alt+1 disable_ligatures_in active always
#:     map alt+2 disable_ligatures_in all never
#:     map alt+3 disable_ligatures_in tab cursor

#: Note that this refers to programming ligatures, typically
#: implemented using the calt OpenType feature. For disabling general
#: ligatures, use the font_features setting.

# font_features

#: E.g. font_features none

#: Choose exactly which OpenType features to enable or disable. This
#: is useful as some fonts might have features worthwhile in a
#: terminal. For example, Fira Code Retina includes a discretionary
#: feature, zero, which in that font changes the appearance of the
#: zero (0), to make it more easily distinguishable from Ø. Fira Code
#: Retina also includes other discretionary features known as
#: Stylistic Sets which have the tags ss01 through ss20.

#: For the exact syntax to use for individual features, see the
#: Harfbuzz documentation <https://harfbuzz.github.io/harfbuzz-hb-common.html#hb-feature-from-string>.

#: Note that this code is indexed by PostScript name, and not the font
#: family. This allows you to define very precise feature settings;
#: e.g. you can disable a feature in the italic font but not in the
#: regular font.

#: On Linux, these are read from the FontConfig database first and
#: then this, setting is applied, so they can be configured in a
#: single, central place.

#: To get the PostScript name for a font, use kitty +list-fonts
#: --psnames:

#: .. code-block:: sh

#:     $ kitty +list-fonts --psnames | grep Fira
#:     Fira Code
#:     Fira Code Bold (FiraCode-Bold)
#:     Fira Code Light (FiraCode-Light)
#:     Fira Code Medium (FiraCode-Medium)
#:     Fira Code Regular (FiraCode-Regular)
#:     Fira Code Retina (FiraCode-Retina)

#: The part in brackets is the PostScript name.

#: Enable alternate zero and oldstyle numerals::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero +onum

#: Enable only alternate zero::

#:     font_features FiraCode-Retina +zero

#: Disable the normal ligatures, but keep the calt feature which (in
#: this font) breaks up monotony::

#:     font_features TT2020StyleB-Regular -liga +calt

#: In conjunction with force_ltr, you may want to disable Arabic
#: shaping entirely, and only look at their isolated forms if they
#: show up in a document. You can do this with e.g.::

# --- [commented-out sam 08/19/2024] ----------
# font_features UnifontMedium +isol -medi -fina -init

# box_drawing_scale 0.001, 1, 1.5, 2

#: Change the sizes of the lines used for the box drawing unicode
#: characters These values are in pts. They will be scaled by the
#: monitor DPI to arrive at a pixel value. There must be four values
#: corresponding to thin, normal, thick, and very thick lines.

# remote_dir .local/share/kitty-ssh-kitten

#: Cursor customization {{{
# cursor none

#: Default cursor color. If set to the special value none the cursor
#: will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. It's color will be
#: the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text will be
#: rendered with the background color of the cell.  Note that if the
#: program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this takes
#: precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast.
# cursor_text_color background

#: Choose the color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered
#: with the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: background. Note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this setting is ignored.

cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline). Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape. Applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular,
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/ in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

cursor_shape_unfocused hollow

#: Defines the text cursor shape when the OS window is not focused. The
#: unfocused cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline, hollow and
#: unchanged (leave the cursor shape as it is).

cursor_beam_thickness 2.5

#: Defines the thickness of the beam cursor (in pts)

cursor_underline_thickness 2.0

#: Defines the thickness of the underline cursor (in pts)

cursor_blink_interval 1 linear ease-out

#: The interval (in seconds) at which to blink the cursor. Set to zero
#: to disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that numbers smaller than repaint_delay will be limited to
#: repaint_delay.

# cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity.  Set to zero to never stop blinking.
