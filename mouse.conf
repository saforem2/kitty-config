#: Mouse {{{

# mouse_hide_wait 3.0

#: Hide mouse cursor after the specified number of seconds of the
#: mouse not being used. Set to zero to disable mouse cursor hiding.
#: Set to a negative value to hide the mouse cursor immediately when
#: typing text. Disabled by default on macOS as getting it to work
#: robustly with the ever-changing sea of bugs that is Cocoa is too
#: much effort.

#: By default, once the cursor is hidden, it is immediately unhidden
#: on any further mouse events.

#: Two formats are supported:
#:  - <hide-wait>
#:  - <hide-wait> <unhide-wait> <unhide-threshold> <scroll-unhide>

#: To change the unhide behavior, the optional parameters <unhide-
#: wait>, <unhide-threshold>, and <scroll-unhide> may be set.

#: <unhide-wait>
#:     Waits for the specified number of seconds after mouse events before unhiding the
#:     mouse cursor. Set to zero to unhide mouse cursor immediately on mouse activity.
#:     This is useful to prevent the mouse cursor from unhiding on accidental swipes on
#:     the trackpad.

#: <unhide-threshold>
#:     Sets the threshold of mouse activity required to unhide the mouse cursor, when
#:     the <unhide-wait> option is non-zero. When <unhide-wait> is zero, this has no
#:     effect.

#:     For example, if <unhide-threshold> is 40 and <unhide-wait> is 2.5, when kitty
#:     detects a mouse event, it records the number of mouse events in the next 2.5
#:     seconds, and checks if that exceeds 40 * 2.5 = 100. If it does, then the mouse
#:     cursor is unhidden, otherwise nothing happens.

#: <scroll-unhide>
#:     Controls what mouse events may unhide the mouse cursor. If enabled, both scroll
#:     and movement events may unhide the cursor. If disabled, only mouse movements can
#:     unhide the cursor.

#: Examples of valid values:
#:  - 0.0
#:  - 1.0
#:  - -1.0
#:  - 0.1 3.0 40 yes

# url_color #0087bd
# url_style curly

#: The color and style for highlighting URLs on mouse-over. url_style
#: can be one of: none, straight, double, curly, dotted, dashed.

open_url_with default

#: The program to open clicked URLs. The special value default will
#: first look for any URL handlers defined via the open_actions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/open_actions/> facility and if non
#: are found, it will use the Operating System's default URL handler
#: (open on macOS and xdg-open on Linux).

url_prefixes file ftp ftps gemini git gopher http https irc ircs kitty mailto news sftp ssh

#: The set of URL prefixes to look for when detecting a URL under the
#: mouse cursor.

detect_urls yes

#: Detect URLs under the mouse. Detected URLs are highlighted with an
#: underline and the mouse cursor becomes a hand over them. Even if
#: this option is disabled, URLs are still clickable. See also the
#: underline_hyperlinks option to control how hyperlinks (as opposed
#: to plain text URLs) are displayed.

url_excluded_characters

#: Additional characters to be disallowed from URLs, when detecting
#: URLs under the mouse cursor. By default, all characters that are
#: legal in URLs are allowed. Additionally, newlines are allowed (but
#: stripped). This is to accommodate programs such as mutt that add
#: hard line breaks even for continued lines. \n can be added to this
#: option to disable this behavior. Special characters can be
#: specified using backslash escapes, to specify a backslash use a
#: double backslash.

show_hyperlink_targets yes

#: When the mouse hovers over a terminal hyperlink, show the actual
#: URL that will be activated when the hyperlink is clicked.

# underline_hyperlinks hover
underline_hyperlinks always

#: Control how hyperlinks are underlined. They can either be
#: underlined on mouse hover, always (i.e. permanently underlined) or
#: never which means that kitty will not apply any underline styling
#: to hyperlinks. Note that the value of always only applies to real
#: (OSC 8) hyperlinks not text that is detected to be a URL on mouse
#: hover. Uses the url_style and url_color settings for the underline
#: style. Note that reloading the config and changing this value
#: to/from always will only affect text subsequently received by
#: kitty.

copy_on_select clipboard

#: Copy to clipboard or a private buffer on select. With this set to
#: clipboard, selecting text with the mouse will cause the text to be
#: copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms such as macOS that do not
#: have the concept of primary selection. You can instead specify a
#: name such as a1 to copy to a private kitty buffer. Map a shortcut
#: with the paste_from_buffer action to paste from this private
#: buffer. For example::

#:     copy_on_select a1
#:     map shift+cmd+v paste_from_buffer a1

#: Note that copying to the clipboard is a security risk, as all
#: programs, including websites open in your browser can read the
#: contents of the system clipboard.

# clear_selection_on_clipboard_loss no

#: When the contents of the clipboard no longer reflect the current
#: selection, clear it. This is primarily useful on platforms such as
#: Linux where selecting text automatically copies it to a special
#: "primary selection" clipboard or if you have copy_on_select set to
#: clipboard.

#: Note that on macOS the system does not provide notifications when
#: the clipboard owner is changed, so there, copying to clipboard in a
#: non-kitty application will not clear selections even if
#: copy_on_select is enabled.

# paste_actions quote-urls-at-prompt,confirm
paste_actions quote-urls-at-prompt,replace-dangerous-control-codes,confirm-if-large

#: A comma separated list of actions to take when pasting text into
#: the terminal. The supported paste actions are:

#: quote-urls-at-prompt:
#:     If the text being pasted is a URL and the cursor is at a shell prompt,
#:     automatically quote the URL (needs shell_integration).
#: replace-dangerous-control-codes
#:     Replace dangerous control codes from pasted text, without confirmation.
#: replace-newline
#:     Replace the newline character from pasted text, without confirmation.
#: confirm:
#:     Confirm the paste if the text to be pasted contains any terminal control codes
#:     as this can be dangerous, leading to code execution if the shell/program running
#:     in the terminal does not properly handle these.
#: confirm-if-large
#:     Confirm the paste if it is very large (larger than 16KB) as pasting
#:     large amounts of text into shells can be very slow.
#: filter:
#:     Run the filter_paste() function from the file paste-actions.py in
#:     the kitty config directory on the pasted text. The text returned by the
#:     function will be actually pasted.
#: no-op:
#:     Has no effect.

strip_trailing_spaces always

#: Remove spaces at the end of lines when copying to clipboard. A
#: value of smart will do it when using normal selections, but not
#: rectangle selections. A value of always will always do it.

# select_by_word_characters @-./_~?&=%+#
# select_by_word_characters @-./_~?&=%+#`.,;
select_by_word_characters @-./_~?&=%+#`

#: Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alphanumeric character in the Unicode database will be matched.

# select_by_word_characters_forward

#: Characters considered part of a word when extending the selection
#: forward on double clicking. In addition to these characters any
#: character that is marked as an alphanumeric character in the
#: Unicode database will be matched.

#: If empty (default) select_by_word_characters will be used for both
#: directions.

# detect_urls yes

#: Detect URLs under the mouse. Detected URLs are highlighted with an
#: underline and the mouse cursor becomes a hand over them. Even if
#: this option is disabled, URLs are still clickable.

# url_excluded_characters

#: Additional characters to be disallowed from URLs, when detecting
#: URLs under the mouse cursor. By default, all characters legal in
#: URLs are allowed.

# copy_on_select clipboard

#: Copy to clipboard or a private buffer on select. With this set to
#: clipboard, simply selecting text with the mouse will cause the text
#: to be copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms such as macOS that
#: do not have the concept of primary selections. You can instead
#: specify a name such as a1 to copy to a private kitty buffer
#: instead. Map a shortcut with the paste_from_buffer action to paste
#: from this private buffer. For example::

#: Note that copying to the clipboard is a security risk, as all
#: programs,c including websites open in your browser can read the
#: contents of the system clipboard.

# strip_trailing_spaces smart

#: Remove spaces at the end of lines when copying to clipboard. A
#: value of smart will do it when using normal selections, but not
#: rectangle selections. always will always do it.


# click_interval -1.0

#: The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple
#: clicks (in seconds). Negative numbers will use the system default
#: instead, if available, or fallback to 0.5.

# focus_follows_mouse no

#: Set the active window to the window under the mouse when moving the
#: mouse around. On macOS, this will also cause the OS Window under
#: the mouse to be focused automatically when the mouse enters it.

# pointer_shape_when_grabbed arrow

#: The shape of the mouse pointer when the program running in the
#: terminal grabs the mouse.

# default_pointer_shape beam

#: The default shape of the mouse pointer.

# pointer_shape_when_dragging beam crosshair

#: The default shape of the mouse pointer when dragging across text.
#: The optional second value sets the shape when dragging in
#: rectangular selection mode.

#: Mouse actions {{{

#: Mouse buttons can be mapped to perform arbitrary actions. The
#: syntax is:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

#: Where button-name is one of left, middle, right, b1 ... b8 with
#: added keyboard modifiers. For example: ctrl+shift+left refers to
#: holding the Ctrl+Shift keys while clicking with the left mouse
#: button. The value b1 ... b8 can be used to refer to up to eight
#: buttons on a mouse.

#: event-type is one of press, release, doublepress, triplepress,
#: click, doubleclick. modes indicates whether the action is performed
#: when the mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal,
#: or not. The values are grabbed or ungrabbed or a comma separated
#: combination of them. grabbed refers to when the program running in
#: the terminal has requested mouse events. Note that the click and
#: double click events have a delay of click_interval to disambiguate
#: from double and triple presses.

#: You can run kitty with the kitty --debug-input command line option
#: to see mouse events. See the builtin actions below to get a sense
#: of what is possible.

#: If you want to unmap a button, map it to nothing. For example, to
#: disable opening of URLs with a plain click::

#:     mouse_map left click ungrabbed

#: See all the mappable actions including mouse actions here
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

#: .. note::
#:     Once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will
#:     automatically end it and no release event will be dispatched.

# clear_all_mouse_actions no

#: Remove all mouse action definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default mouse actions.

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor

# mouse_map left click ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  First check for a selection and if one exists do nothing. Then
#::  check for a link under the mouse cursor and if one exists, click

#: Mouse buttons can be remapped to perform arbitrary actions. The
#: syntax for doing so is:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

#: Where ``button-name`` is one of ``left``, ``middle``, ``right`` or
#: ``b1 ... b8`` with added keyboard modifiers, for example:
#: ``ctrl+shift+left`` refers to holding the ctrl+shift keys while
#: clicking with the left mouse button. The number ``b1 ... b8`` can
#: be used to refer to upto eight buttons on a mouse.

#: ``event-type`` is one ``press``, ``release``, ``doublepress``,
#: ``triplepress``, ``click`` and ``doubleclick``.  ``modes``
#: indicates whether the action is performed when the mouse is grabbed
#: by the program running in the terminal, or not. It can have one or
#: more or the values, ``grabbed,ungrabbed``. ``grabbed`` refers to
#: when the program running in the terminal has requested mouse
#: events. Note that the click and double click events have a delay of
#: click_interval to disambiguate from double and triple presses.

#: You can run kitty with the kitty --debug-input command line option
#: to see mouse events. See the builtin actions below to get a sense
#: of what is possible.

#: If you want to unmap an action map it to ``no-op``. For example, to
