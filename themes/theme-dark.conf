#: The foreground and background colors

background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this setting when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped.

background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

dynamic_background_opacity yes

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this setting by reloading the config is not supported.

background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
#: tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. Makes
#: it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the current
#: background color for each window. This setting applies only if
#: background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported or
#: background_image is set.

dim_opacity 0.40

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

selection_foreground #1c1c1c
selection_background #ffff00

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.
